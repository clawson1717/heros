# HeRoS - Hindsight-driven Reinforcement with Subgoal Milestones

A research framework combining hindsight-based relabeling with hierarchical subgoal milestones for improved sample efficiency in reinforcement learning.

## Overview

HeRoS draws from two key innovations:
- **Hindsight Experience Replay (HER)** — relabels failed trajectories as successful toward reached states
- **MiRA-style subgoal decomposition** — hierarchical planning with intermediate milestones
- **OS-Themis-style milestone critics** — value estimation at subgoal granularity

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
